### What is this?

This web app is designed to predict the next word given a portion of a sentence as input.
The idea is to provide a tool similar to any Android/iOS keyboards which usually present a few input suggestions while typing.

### What do I do?

Just type your sentence inside the text box and choose the number of predictions to display.

### How does it work?

The tool has been trained on data coming from blogs, news articles and Twitter provided by [SwiftKey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_SwiftKey).
The underlying algorithm is a variant of the [Kneser-Ney smoothing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kneser%E2%80%93Ney_smoothing) probability computation.
